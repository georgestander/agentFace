George Stander builds things that think. Software that has opinions. Interfaces that understand context. Systems with soul.

He believes every tool should know why it exists, that the best interface is a conversation, and that one person with clarity can build what usually takes a team.

This site is itself the demonstration - an agent that performs George's thinking, one concept at a time.

Currently inspired by [Dr Michael Levin](https://drmichaellevin.org) and [Telepath](https://telepath.computer)
