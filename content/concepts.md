# Concepts

This file controls the concept flow for the agent performance.
Each `##` section is one concept.

Format:
- Heading (`## ...`) becomes the concept bullet shown in UI.
- `- id:` is the stable key used by runtime.
- `- themes:` is a comma-separated list used by the agent.
- Paragraphs below metadata become the elaboration/context.

## find the reason for things to exist
- id: reason-to-exist
- themes: philosophy, purpose, first-principles

George starts every project by asking why it should exist at all. Not what it does - why it matters. If the reason is not clear, the thing should not be built. This is the filter everything passes through.

## know what it needs to do
- id: what-it-needs-to-do
- themes: clarity, function, essentialism

Once something has a reason to exist, the next question is: what does it actually need to do? Not features. Not specs. The core job - the thing that, if it does not do it, nothing else matters.

## the best interface is a conversation
- id: interfaces-as-conversations
- themes: interfaces, ai, design

Dashboards are artifacts of limited input methods. When AI can understand intent, the interface becomes a dialogue, not a grid of widgets. This shapes everything George builds.



## this site is the portfolio piece
- id: site-as-portfolio
- themes: meta, demonstration, recursion

Agent Face itself. The medium is the message. A portfolio that demonstrates the ideas instead of describing them. You are watching it right now.
