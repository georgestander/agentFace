Agent Face is not a case study page about ideas. It is the ideas, running.

Instead of describing principles, the agent performs them concept by concept.

Each step chooses a different UI tool, reasons in public, and reveals intent through interaction.

That keeps the experience alive: not a static website, but an evolving presentation.

The portfolio becomes proof through behavior, not claims.
