summary: Thought is not linear. Connexus explores branching conversations for deeper idea development.
---

Connexus came from repeatedly losing good ideas in long chat threads.

Real thinking branches. We revisit assumptions, split paths, and compare alternatives.

Linear chat hides that structure, so context decays fast.

Connexus experiments with conversations as trees instead of timelines.

The goal is simple: preserve momentum while making it easy to zoom in, zoom out, and reconnect threads.

When structure matches how we think, the interface gets out of the way.
