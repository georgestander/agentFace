### Inspiration from childlike wonder.

When I was 12, I created a Windows 95 copy design called "Mirrors 95." My art teacher had no idea what it was and failed me for the project. But I thought it was cool! I was fascinated by Bill Gates and wanted to build something like Windows.

Even back then, I dreamed of creating a thinking, sensing computer like HAL or Jarvis. My ideas have always stretched what seemed possible.

This weird little site is inspired by that same childhood wonder, and by the amazing work from the team at [Telepath](https://telepath.computer).
