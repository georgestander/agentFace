summary: Agents should have desks, not toolbars. A workspace-first operating model for AI collaboration.
---

WorkspaceOS started as a simple frustration: every AI product looked like a chatbot strapped to a sidebar.

That pattern treats the agent like a feature. I wanted to treat it like a colleague.

If a colleague needs context, memory, and room to work, the interface should reflect that reality.

So the core question became: what does an agent desk look like?

It needed clear boundaries, persistent state, and explicit ownership of tasks. Not magical hand-waving.

The point was never novelty. The point was reducing friction so human intent and agent execution can stay aligned.
