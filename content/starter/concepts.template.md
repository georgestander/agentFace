# Concepts (Starter Template)

This is an owner-agnostic starter template.
Copy this into `content/concepts.md` only if you want to replace current concepts.

Format:
- Heading (`## ...`) becomes the concept bullet shown in UI.
- `- id:` is the stable key used by runtime.
- `- themes:` is a comma-separated list used by the agent.
- Paragraphs below metadata become elaboration/context.

## define the reason to exist
- id: reason-to-exist
- themes: strategy, purpose, first-principles

Start with the core reason this should exist. If that reason is weak, pause and refine before building more.

## identify the minimum useful outcome
- id: minimum-useful-outcome
- themes: product, focus, execution

Describe the smallest outcome that still creates value. This keeps scope honest and momentum high.

## make interaction feel like dialogue
- id: interaction-as-dialogue
- themes: ux, ai, interface-design

Prefer intent-driven interactions over interface clutter. Use the simplest medium that keeps the user oriented.

## show the work, not only the claims
- id: evidence-over-claims
- themes: trust, craft, storytelling

Demonstrate the thinking through concrete artifacts, examples, and outcomes instead of purely declarative copy.
