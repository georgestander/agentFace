## George's Projects

### WorkspaceOS
- Status: Building
- Description: An agent-native workspace application. Rethinking how humans and AI agents collaborate — not AI bolted onto existing tools, but a new paradigm where agents are first-class participants.
- Tags: AI, Interfaces, RedwoodSDK, Cloudflare
- What makes it interesting: It's not about adding a chatbot to a dashboard. It's about what work looks like when AI agents have their own space to operate alongside humans.

### Connexus
- Status: Building
- Description: A branching, non-linear chat interface. Conversations with AI shouldn't be forced into a single thread — they should branch, merge, and flow like thought itself.
- Tags: AI, UX, Chat, Non-linear
- What makes it interesting: Challenges the fundamental assumption that chat is linear. Born from George's frustration with losing context in long AI conversations.

### AI Reading Companion
- Status: Concept / Early MVP
- Description: An AI companion that uses a phone camera with gaze tracking and expressive TTS to make reading engaging. Designed for George and his son Liam.
- Tags: AI, Computer Vision, TTS, Education, Personal
- What makes it interesting: Started as a personal need — George wanting to enjoy reading again and share that with Liam. Uses OpenCV for gaze tracking, expressive voice for narration. MVP: phone camera + AirPods.

### Clinical Trial Budgeting Engine
- Status: Building (at VIR)
- Description: A budgeting engine for clinical trials with global labor benchmarks and Middle East regional modifiers (UAE, KSA, Oman, Kuwait). Uses benchmarks from DIA, ICON, and IQVIA.
- Tags: Clinical Research, Enterprise, HEOR
- What makes it interesting: Enterprise-grade tool built by one person. Solves a real pain point in clinical research where budgeting is still done in spreadsheets.

### CRO Builder v0.4
- Status: Building (at VIR)
- Description: Contract Research Organization management tool with Microsoft SSO integration.
- Tags: Enterprise, Clinical Research, SSO

### RepoGhost

- Description: A tool for working with code repositories.
- Tags: Developer Tools

### Notely
- Status: Shipped
- Description: A note-taking application.
- Tags: Productivity

### TouchMe Marketplace
- Status: Shipped
- Description: A marketplace platform.

### Agent Face (this site)
- Status: Building
- Description: This very site — an AI agent that represents George, converses with visitors, and dynamically renders UI to communicate who he is. Built with RedwoodSDK, json-render, and OpenRouter.
- Tags: AI, Meta, RedwoodSDK, json-render
- What makes it interesting: The site IS the portfolio piece. It demonstrates everything George believes about AI-native interfaces.
